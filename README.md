# Surfs Up Analysis 

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
A business plan is in the works to open a surf and ice-cream shop on the beautiful island of Oahu. A potential investor and surf enthusiast will pitch the proposal to fellow shareholders. Using Jupyter Notebook and SQLAlchemy, this analysis provides detailed climate reports which will help determine whether or not the location of the surf ice-cream shop on Oahu will be a good investment. If the shop is a success, there is potential to open a chain of stores across the islands of Hawaii pending more analysis for each island.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

- The chart above compares temperatures for June and December on the island of Oahu. It is evident that the average temperature in June (74.9°F) is almost 4°F warmer than the average temperature in December (71.0°F).
- However, there is also more spread in the temperature ranges in December compared to June. In December, the range between the minimum (56.0°F) and maximum (83.0°F) is 27°F, the range between the minimum (65.0°F) and maximum (85.0°F) is a 20°F difference in June.
- The standard variation in December (σ = 3.75°F) is also greater than June (σ = 3.28°F) which reflects the greater difference in temperature fluctuations for the winter month.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
